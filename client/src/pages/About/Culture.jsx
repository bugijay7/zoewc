          From the top apex downwards, we believe in Christ Principles â€” that
          leaders are led and lead by example through accountability, self-responsibility,
          loyalty to the vision, availability, assignment commitment, transparency,
          time consciousness, unity of purpose, forgiveness, and result-based celebration.

          {"\n\n"}Welcome to Zoe Family â€” Welcome to Zoe, the World of John 10:10b and
          2 Corinthians 3:18.

          {"\n\n"}Welcome on board! zoe worship centre is the hub of divine information,
          where we are transformed and inspired to inspire generations.

          {"\n\n"}Welcome to a family where you are no longer a church member but a
          minister in the making â€” reaching out to the lost.

          {"\n\n"}Welcome to a church where the limit is not the sky, but yourself.

          {"\n\n"}Welcome to the class of learning and re-learning, where your culture
          is transformed into a Supra-culture.

          {"\n\n"}Welcome to an environment of divine encounters with the Word and
          the Spirit of God.

          {"\n\n"}Welcome to a dimension where the voice of God is present and real.

          {"\n\n"}In Zoe, we are a family that runs the race of faith together,
          cares for one another, and celebrates our success.
