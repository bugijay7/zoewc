          WE BELIEVE THE BIBLE â€” to be the inspired, authoritative Word of God.  
          (2 Peter 1:21; 2 Timothy 3:15â€“17)

          {"\n\n"}WE BELIEVE THE GODHEAD â€” consisting of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

          {"\n\n"}WE BELIEVE IN THE KEEPING POWER OF GOD AND A HOLY WALK â€” to walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit.  
          (Jude 1:24; Romans 8:4)

          {"\n\n"}WE BELIEVE IN THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST â€” and the believersâ€™ baptism in water by immersion.
